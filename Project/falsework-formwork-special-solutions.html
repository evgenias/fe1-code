						<p>Architects may be fond of coming up with extravagant and elaborate designs for everything from bridges to skyscrapers, but the challenge for contractors is to execute these complex schemes on time and on budget. It is an area where suppliers can not only help with technical advice and specialist design services, but also suggest ways to make the construction process more efficient.</p>
						<p>When it comes to falsework and formwork, this often means providing solutions that allow complex and ever-changing shapes to be constructed using standard components that are easy to handle and modify on site.</p>
						<p>Peri for example has seen its Variokit modular system being used for construction of a steel composite bridge over the extended Lanaye lock facility in Belgium, on the border with the Netherlands. Although based on standard rentable components, the formwork system has a complex function, acting as both a movable carriage and a cantilever bracket.</p>
						<p>The locks link the Albert Canal with Juliana Canal, a side channel from the River Meuse. Construction of additional lock chambers will quadruple capacity, and as part of this project, a new 200 m long road bridge, with a 136 m main span, is being built across the shipping channel.</p>

						<h4>Airport foundations</h4>
						<p>In June last year, the contract to build a new AED 10.8 billion (US$ 2.9 billion) terminal building at Abu Dhabi International Airport in the UAE was awarded to a consortium comprising TAV, CCC and Arabtec. The structure will include 65 gates and it is expected to open in 2017.</p>
						<p>The early stages of construction includes the sinking of some 1,860 piles of diameters as large as 1 m to depths up to 25 m. On top of groups of piles sits a cast concrete head, which can be up to 22 m long, depending on how many foundations it links together – usually between two and 10 piles.</p>
						<p>Paschal supplied its GE universal formwork for the construction of these pile heads, and one key feature is that it can be adjusted to the last centimetre, although 50 mm steps were adequate for the different foundation geometries. This meant the formwork for 16 different types of foundations could be cast from the same formwork units.</p>
						<p>The modular formwork has a 15 mm thick, 11-layer plywood face made of Finnish beech. The frame comprises a steel frame which is easy to clean and repair, and the light weight of the individual elements means it is suitable for the manual placing – a key factor on this project as a crane was not always available.</p>

						<h4>Affordable solution</h4>
						<p>At Barranquilla on Colombia’s Caribbean coast, the national housing ministry is building a new quarter called “Las Gardenias” with a total of 5,000 affordable apartments. Traditionally, residential construction in Colombia is carried out without a crane. Walls and slabs are poured in one go to save time and instead of plastering the walls, they are left as they are.</p>
						<p>This meant the Unión Temporal Havivir contractor consortium required a formwork solution that was easy and quick to assemble by hand and robust enough for tough environmental and site conditions. It also needed a formwork face that could deliver a high-quality finish time after time and which could survive humid weather, and the system it went for was Meva’s AluFix hand-set formwork with Alkus all-plastic facing.</p>
						<p>Although this is a relatively simple formwork solution, it was still a leap ahead in technology terms in Colombia, where projects on this scale normally use make-shift timber forms and props.</p>
						<p>The walls of the apartments are 2.30 m high and 80 mm thick, while the slabs are 100 mm thick. AluFix covers the slab formwork with the same standard panels that are used for the walls, simply using props with special prop heads. This solution answered the contractor’s need for a simple system with a fast to set-up time.</p>
						<p>With a capacity of up to 55 kN/m² concrete pressure, the formwork allows 2.30 m high walls to be completed in a single pour, along with the slab. One set of formwork is needed to complete all five levels of a building.</p>
						<p>Thanks to the ambient temperatures of 25 to 35°C the concrete sets quickly, allowing the formwork to be struck soon after the pour. Another time advantage comes from the Alkus all-plastic facing, which was cleaned on site, and which is simple to repair if need be.</p>
						<p>The project is due for completion next year and is progressing at a rate of 20 apartments per day, instead of the targeted 16 apartments per day. In addition to these a complete residential infrastructure is being developed on the site covering almost 5 ha, including community facilities, medical centres and schools, set in an extensive park.</p>
						<p>This all goes to show that whether it is a complex bridge pylon or a simple apartment structure, formwork suppliers have a lot to offer from technical assistance to providing systems that can speed up work.</p>
